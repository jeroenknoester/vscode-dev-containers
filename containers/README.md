# Development Container Definitions

This folder contains a set of development container configuration files or "definitions".
You can use them instead of the configuration files of the [Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) extension. 

Each folder contains a README with more details on the contents of the definition and how to use it.
